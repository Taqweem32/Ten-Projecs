            <h1>Prime Minister of Pakistan</h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi</strong>(Urdu: عمران احمد خان نیازی
              , pronounced [ɪmɾaːn ɛɦməd xaːn nɪjaːziː]; born 5 October 1952) is
              a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who served as the 22nd
              prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. He
              is the founder and former chairman of the political party Pakistan
              Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from 1996 to 2023. He was the captain of the
              Pakistan national cricket team throughout the 1980s and early
              1990s. Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford.
              He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series
              against England. Khan played until 1992, served as the team's
              captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992, and won the 1992
              Cricket World Cup, Pakistan's only victory in the competition.
              Considered one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, Khan was later
              inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Founding the Pakistan
              Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National
              Assembly in the 2002 general election, serving as an opposition
              member from Mianwali until 2007. PTI boycotted the 2008 general
              election and became the second-largest party by popular vote in
              the 2013 general election. In the 2018 general election, running
              on a populist platform, PTI became the largest party in the
              National Assembly, and formed a coalition government with
              independents with Khan as prime minister.
